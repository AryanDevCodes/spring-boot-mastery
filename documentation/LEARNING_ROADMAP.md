## 🎯 **Tips for Effective Learning**

### 1. **Active Learning**
- Don't just read - type out the examples
- Modify code to see what happens
- Break things and fix them

### 2. **Documentation Habit**
- Keep notes on what each annotation does
- Document patterns you discover
- Create your own examples

### 3. **Testing Mindset**
- Always run the applications
- Check logs and outputs
- Use debugger to understand flow

### 4. **Progressive Building**
- Start with simple examples
- Gradually increase complexity
- Build on previous knowledge

### 5. **Real-World Context**
- Relate annotations to real business problems
- Think about why each annotation exists
- Consider alternatives and trade-offs

---

## 🆘 **Getting Help**

### When Stuck:
1. Check `ANNOTATIONS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for syntax
2. Read detailed explanations in `SPRING_ANNOTATIONS_GUIDE.md`
3. Look at similar examples in other projects
4. Check application logs for error messages
5. Use Spring Boot documentation online

### Common Issues:
- **Application won't start**: Check for missing dependencies or configuration errors
- **Beans not found**: Verify component scanning and package structure
- **JSON not parsing**: Ensure `@RequestBody` and proper content-type headers
- **Database errors**: Check entity mappings and transaction boundaries
